          `Error: std::convert::Into<eyre::Report>`
          which is required by `Error: eyre::kind::TraitKind`
          `Error: std::fmt::Display`
          which is required by `&Error: eyre::kind::AdhocKind`
          `&Error: std::convert::Into<eyre::Report>`
          which is required by `&Error: eyre::kind::TraitKind`
  = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
