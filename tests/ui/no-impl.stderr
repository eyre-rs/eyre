  = note: the method `eyre_kind` exists but the following trait bounds were not satisfied:
          `Error: std::convert::Into<eyre::Report<_>>`
          which is required by `Error: eyre::kind::TraitKind<_>`
          `Error: std::fmt::Display`
          which is required by `&Error: eyre::kind::AdhocKind`
          `&Error: std::convert::Into<eyre::Report<_>>`
          which is required by `&Error: eyre::kind::TraitKind<_>`
  = note: this error originates in a macro (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
