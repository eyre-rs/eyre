This library provides [`eyre::Report`][Report], a trait object based
error handling type for easy idiomatic error handling and reporting in Rust
applications.

This crate is a fork of [`anyhow`] by @dtolnay. By default this crate does not
add any new features that anyhow doesn't already support, though it does rename
a number of the APIs to try to make the intended usage more obvious. The magic
of this crate is when you need to add extra context to a chain of errors beyond
what you can or should insert into the error chain. For an example of a
customized version of eyre check out
[`jane-eyre`](https://github.com/yaahc/jane-eyre).

My goal in writing this crate is to explore new ways to associate context with
errors, to cleanly separate the concept of an error and context about an error,
and to more clearly communicate the intended usage of this crate via changes to
the API.

The main changes this crate brings to anyhow are

* Addition of the [`eyre::EyreContext`] trait and a type parameter on the core
  error handling type which users can use to insert custom forms of context
  into their catch-all error handling type.
* Rebranding the type as principally for error reporting, rather than
  describing it as an error type in its own right. What is and isn't an error
  is a fuzzy concept, for the purposes of this crate though errors are types
  that implement `std::error::Error`, and you'll notice that this trait
  implementation is conspicuously absent on `Report`. Instead it contains
  errors that it masqerades as, and provides helpers for creating new errors to
  wrap those errors and for displaying those chains of errors, and the included
  context, to the end user. The goal is to make it obvious that this type is
  meant to be used when the only way you expect to handle errors is to print
  them.
* Changing the [`anyhow::Context`] trait to [`eyre::WrapErr`] to make it clear
  that it is unrelated to the [`eyre::EyreContext`] trait and member, and is
  only for inserting new errors into the chain of errors.
* Addition of new context helpers `member_ref`/`member_mut` on `EyreContext`
  and `context`/`context_mut` on `Report` for working with the custom
  context and extracting forms of context based on their type independent of
  the type of the custom context.

These changes were made in order to facilitate the usage of
[`tracing_error::SpanTrace`] with anyhow, which is a Backtrace-like type for
rendering custom defined runtime context setup via tracing spans.

```toml
[dependencies]
eyre = "0.3"
```
<br>

## Customization

In order to insert your own custom context type you must first implement the
`eyre::EyreContext` trait for said type, which has two required methods and
three optional methods.

### Required Methods

* `fn default(error: &Error) -> Self` - For constructing default context while
allowing special case handling depending on the content of the error you're
wrapping.

This is essentially `Default::default` but more flexible, for example, the
`eyre::DefaultContext` type provide by this crate uses this to only capture a
`Backtrace` if the inner `Error` does not already have one.

```rust
fn default(error: &(dyn StdError + 'static)) -> Self {
    let backtrace = backtrace_if_absent!(error);

    Self { backtrace }
}
```

* `fn debug(&self, error: &(dyn Error + 'static), f: &mut fmt::Formatter<'_>)
  -> fmt Result` and optionally `display` - For formatting the entire error
  chain and the user provided context.

When overriding the context it no longer makes sense for `eyre::Report` to
provide the `Display` and `Debug` implementations for the user, becase we
cannot predict what forms of context you will need to display along side your
chain of errors. Instead we forward the implementations of `Display` and
`Debug` to these methods on the inner `EyreContext` type.

This crate does provide a few helpers to assist in writing display
implementations, specifically the `Chain` type, for treating an error and its
sources like an iterator, and the `Indented` type, for indenting multi line
errors consistently without using heap allocations.

**Note**: best practices for printing errors suggest that `{}` should only
print the current error and none of its sources, and that the primary method of
displaying an error, its sources, and its context should be handled by the
`Debug` implementation, which is what is used to print errors that are returned
from `main`. For examples on how to implement this please refer to the
implementations of `display` and `debug` on `eyre::DefaultContext`

### Optional Methods

* `fn member_ref(&self, typeid TypeID) -> Option<&dyn Any>` - For extracting
  arbitrary members from a context based on their type and `member_mut` for
  getting a mutable reference in the same way.

This method is like a flexible version of the `fn backtrace(&self)` method on
the `Error` trait. The main `Report` type provides versions of these methods
that use type inference to get the typeID that should be used by inner trait fn
to pick a member to return.

**Note**: The `backtrace()` fn on `Report` relies on the implementation of
this function to get the backtrace from the user provided context if one
exists. If you wish your type to guaruntee that it captures a backtrace for any
error it wraps you **must** implement `member_ref` and provide a path to return
a `Backtrace` type like below.

Here is how the `eyre::DefaultContext` type uses this to return `Backtrace`s.

```rust
fn member_ref(&self, typeid: TypeId) -> Option<&dyn Any> {
    if typeid == TypeId::of::<Backtrace>() {
        self.backtrace.as_ref().map(|b| b as &dyn Any)
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

Once you've defined a custom Context type you can use it throughout your
application by defining a type alias.


```rust
type Report = eyre::Report<MyContext>;

// And optionally...
type Result<T, E = eyre::Report<MyContext>> = core::result::Result<T, E>;
```

<br>

## Details

- Use `Result<T, eyre::Report>`, or equivalently `eyre::Result<T>`, as the
  return type of any fallible function.

  Within the function, use `?` to easily propagate any error that implements the
  `std::error::Error` trait.

  ```rust
  use eyre::Result;

  fn get_cluster_info() -> Result<ClusterMap> {
      let config = std::fs::read_to_string("cluster.json")?;
      let map: ClusterMap = serde_json::from_str(&config)?;
      Ok(map)
  }
  ```

- Wrap a lower level error with a new error created from a message to help the
  person troubleshooting understand what the chain of failures that occured. A
  low-level error like "No such file or directory" can be annoying to debug
  without more information about what higher level step the application was in
  the middle of.

  ```rust
  use eyre::{WrapErr, Result};

  fn main() -> Result<()> {
      ...
      it.detach().wrap_err("Failed to detach the important thing")?;

      let content = std::fs::read(path)
          .wrap_err_with(|| format!("Failed to read instrs from {}", path))?;
      ...
  }
  ```

  ```console
  Error: Failed to read instrs from ./path/to/instrs.json

  Caused by:
      No such file or directory (os error 2)
  ```

- Downcasting is supported and can be by value, by shared reference, or by
  mutable reference as needed.

  ```rust
  // If the error was caused by redaction, then return a
  // tombstone instead of the content.
  match root_cause.downcast_ref::<DataStoreError>() {
      Some(DataStoreError::Censored(_)) => Ok(Poll::Ready(REDACTED_CONTENT)),
      None => Err(error),
  }
  ```

- If using the nightly channel, a backtrace is captured and printed with the
  error if the underlying error type does not already provide its own. In order
  to see backtraces, they must be enabled through the environment variables
  described in [`std::backtrace`]:

  - If you want panics and errors to both have backtraces, set
    `RUST_BACKTRACE=1`;
  - If you want only errors to have backtraces, set `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE=1`;
  - If you want only panics to have backtraces, set `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` and
    `RUST_LIB_BACKTRACE=0`.

  The tracking issue for this feature is [rust-lang/rust#53487].

  [`std::backtrace`]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/backtrace/index.html#environment-variables
  [rust-lang/rust#53487]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/53487

- Eyre works with any error type that has an impl of `std::error::Error`,
  including ones defined in your crate. We do not bundle a `derive(Error)` macro
  but you can write the impls yourself or use a standalone macro like
  [thiserror].

  ```rust
  use thiserror::Error;

  #[derive(Error, Debug)]
  pub enum FormatError {
      #[error("Invalid header (expected {expected:?}, got {found:?})")]
      InvalidHeader {
          expected: String,
          found: String,
      },
      #[error("Missing attribute: {0}")]
      MissingAttribute(String),
  }
  ```

- One-off error messages can be constructed using the `eyre!` macro, which
  supports string interpolation and produces an `eyre::Report`.

  ```rust
  return Err(eyre!("Missing attribute: {}", missing));
  ```

<br>

## No-std support

**NOTE**: tests are currently broken for `no_std` so I cannot guaruntee that
everything works still. I'm waiting for upstream fixes to be merged rather than
fixing them myself, so bear with me.

In no_std mode, the same API is almost all available and works the same way. To
depend on Eyre in no_std mode, disable our default enabled "std" feature in
Cargo.toml. A global allocator is required.

```toml
[dependencies]
eyre = { version = "0.3", default-features = false }
```

Since the `?`-based error conversions would normally rely on the
`std::error::Error` trait which is only available through std, no_std mode will
require an explicit `.map_err(Report::msg)` when working with a non-Eyre error
type inside a function that returns Eyre's error type.

<br>

## Comparison to failure

The `eyre::Report` type works something like `failure::Error`, but unlike
failure ours is built around the standard library's `std::error::Error` trait
rather than a separate trait `failure::Fail`. The standard library has adopted
the necessary improvements for this to be possible as part of [RFC 2504].

[RFC 2504]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2504-fix-error.md

<br>

## Comparison to thiserror

Use Eyre if you don't care what error type your functions return, you just
want it to be easy. This is common in application code. Use [thiserror] if you
are a library that wants to design your own dedicated error type(s) so that on
failures the caller gets exactly the information that you choose.

## Incompatibilities with anyhow

Beyond the fact that eyre renames many of the core APIs in anyhow the addition
of the type parameter makes the `eyre!` macro not work in certain places where
`anyhow!` does work. In
anyhow the following is valid.

```rust
// Works
let val = get_optional_val.ok_or_else(|| anyhow!("failed to get value")).unwrap();
```

Where as with `eyre!` this will fail due to being unable to infer the type for
the Context parameter. The solution to this problem, should you encounter it,
is to give the compiler a hint for what type it should be resolving to, either
via your return type or a type annotation.

```rust
// Broken
let val = get_optional_val.ok_or_else(|| eyre!("failed to get value")).unwrap();

// Works
let val: Report = get_optional_val.ok_or_else(|| eyre!("failed to get value")).unwrap();
```
